### 👋 Hi, I'm Phan Trinh

I'm a SysAdmin/IT Consultant, working/have worked in Healthcare and Finance sectors. I'm a big *Phan* of network defense.

- 📝 [Blog](https://aptrinh.js.org/): Where I write things about gaming or some cool tech things    
- 🌱 I'm learning Russian, Norwegian (Bokmal) and Japanese, along with automation on Github. This README will be automated soon!
